    "content": "<div>Let's start by understanding the layout of a piano. The keyboard is made up of repeating patterns of <b>white</b> and <b>black keys</b>.<ul><li>The <b>white keys</b> are labeled <b>A through G</b>, and once you reach G, the pattern starts over at A.</li><li>The <b>black keys</b> sit in groups of twos and threes and don't have unique letter names. Instead, each black key is named based on the white key it's next to:<ul><li>If you go <b>up</b> from a white key, the black key is called a <b>sharp</b> (♯)</li><li>If you go <b>down</b>, it's called a <b>flat</b> (♭)</li></ul></li><li>For example:<ul><li>The black key between C and D can be called <b>C♯</b> or <b>D♭</b></li><li>They're the same note, just named differently depending on the musical context</li></ul></li></ul>Before we can build chords, we need to start with a <b>scale</b>—a group of notes played in order, step by step. Think of it like a musical staircase.<p>The easiest place to begin is with the <b>C Major scale</b>, which uses only white keys:<br><b>C – D – E – F – G – A – B – C</b></p><p><b>Click on the button to see the C major scale!</b></p></div>",

    "title": "Understanding Intervals",
    "content": "<div>An <b>interval</b> is the distance between two notes on the piano. The smallest possible interval is called a <b>half step</b>—that's when you go from one key to the very next key, whether it's white or black. A <b>whole step</b> is simply <b>two half steps</b>.</div><br><div>You'll need to understand intervals to build chords, because the spacing between notes (not just the notes themselves) is what gives chords their emotional character.</div>"
