    "title": "Understanding Piano Notes",
    "content": "Let's start with the basics! The piano keyboard has a pattern of black and white keys. The white keys are named using letters from A to G. Look at the piano below - notice how this pattern repeats across the keyboard. The black keys are called sharps (♯) when named after the white key below them, or flats (♭) when named after the white key above them. For example, the black key between C and D can be called either C♯ or D♭. Let's explore the C major scale to understand this pattern!",

    "title": "Major vs Minor: The Emotional Color of Music",
    "content": "Major and minor chords create different emotional responses in music. Major chords often sound bright, happy, and uplifting, while minor chords tend to sound more melancholic, mysterious, or sad. Many songs use this to set their emotional tone. Famous examples in major key include 'Hey Jude' by The Beatles and 'Don't Stop Believin'' by Journey. Well-known minor key songs include 'Nothing Else Matters' by Metallica and 'Eleanor Rigby' by The Beatles. Let's hear the difference with 'A Whole New World' from Aladdin played in both major (original) and minor keys. Click the buttons below to hear how the same melody can create completely different emotional experiences!",

    "title": "Building Chords",
    "content": "A chord is built by playing three or more notes together. The most common chords are built using three notes: the root (starting note), the third (3rd note up), and the fifth (5th note up). The difference between major and minor chords lies in the third - major chords use a major third (4 half steps up), while minor chords use a minor third (3 half steps up). Let's look at C major and C minor chords. In C major, we use C (root) + E (major 3rd) + G (5th). In C minor, we use C (root) + Eb (minor 3rd) + G (5th). Click the buttons to hear how they sound!",
